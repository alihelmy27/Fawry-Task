Step 1: Verify DNS Resolution
-Compare resolution from /etc/resolv.conf DNS vs. 8.8.8.8:
1-Check DNS configuration in /etc/resolv.conf: cat /etc/resolv.conf
2-Test DNS resolution with internal DNS: nslookup internal.example.com
3-Test DNS resolution with Google’s DNS (8.8.8.8): nslookup internal.example.com 8.8.8.8
Results:
1-If the internal DNS resolves correctly and Google DNS does not, the issue is likely with your internal DNS server.
2-If neither resolves, it might be a network or DNS configuration issue outside of the server.

Step 2: Diagnose Service Reachability
-Confirm whether the web service (port 80 or 443) is reachable on the resolved IP:
1-Use curl to test if the web service is reachable:
curl http://<resolved_IP>  # For HTTP
curl https://<resolved_IP>  # For HTTPS
2-Use telnet to test port reachability:
telnet <resolved_IP> 80  # Test HTTP port
telnet <resolved_IP> 443  # Test HTTPS port
3-Use netstat to check if the service is listening on the correct port:
netstat -tuln | grep ':80\|:443'
Results:
These commands will confirm whether the web server is listening on the expected ports (80 or 443).

Step 3 & 4: List All Possible Causes & Propose and Apply Fixes
1-DNS issues:
-Misconfigured DNS entries in /etc/resolv.conf (pointing to an incorrect or down DNS server).
-DNS server failure (e.g., internal DNS server might be down or unreachable).
Confirm: Try using nslookup with a different DNS (e.g., 8.8.8.8) to see if the issue persists. If the internal DNS doesn’t resolve but Google’s DNS does, the problem lies with your internal DNS server.
Fix : Update /etc/resolv.conf with a working DNS server, or restart the internal DNS service if it's misbehaving.

2-Service availability issues:
-The web service might be down or not responding on port 80 or 443.
-The firewall on the server or network might be blocking access to port 80 or 443.
-The web service is not properly configured to accept external connections.
Confirm: Run ss or netstat to check if the service is actively listening on port 80 or 443.
         Use curl to check if the service is responsive on these ports.
Fix : If the service is down, restart the web server , If firewall is blocking the ports, allow traffic on 80/443.

3-Network connectivity issues:
-Network routing issues between the client system and the server.
-Issues with internal routers, firewalls, or proxies blocking communication.
Confirm: Test connectivity using ping and traceroute -> ping internal.example.com
                                                        traceroute internal.example.com
Fix : If it's a local routing issue, verify the routes on the client system.
